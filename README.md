Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Overview
Pneumonia is a severe lung infection that can cause significant health complications and is a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in children and older adults. Early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia can greatly improve treatment outcomes.

This project leverages deep learning techniques to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia using chest X-ray images. By utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a pretrained VGG16 model fine-tuned for binary classification, the system can identify whether an X-ray image represents a normal lung or one affected by pneumonia.

The project also includes a Flask-based web application to provide an intuitive interface where users can upload X-ray images and receive instant predictions.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload chest X-ray images in PNG, JPEG, or JPG formats for analysis.
Prediction: The system provides binary predictions (Normal or Pneumonia) along with a confidence score.
Pretrained Model: Uses the VGG16 architecture, fine-tuned to detect pneumonia with high accuracy.
Web Application: An interactive web interface is built using Flask for seamless user experience.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled chest X-ray images. It is organized into three subsets:

Training: Used to train the model on a diverse set of labeled examples.
Validation: Used to tune model hyperparameters and evaluate during training.
Testing: Used to assess the model's generalization on unseen data.
The dataset contains two main categories:

Normal: X-ray images of healthy lungs.
Pneumonia: X-ray images indicating bacterial or viral pneumonia.

Model Architecture
The model is built using the VGG16 architecture, a robust and proven deep learning model for image recognition tasks. Key features of the model include:

Pretrained Weights: The model is initialized with weights from ImageNet to leverage transfer learning.
Fine-Tuning: Layers are adjusted and retrained to specialize in pneumonia detection.
Binary Classification: The final dense layers are customized to output predictions for two classes: Normal and Pneumonia.
The training process involves:

Data Augmentation: To improve generalization by simulating diverse X-ray conditions.
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy for optimizing classification performance.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient learning.
Early Stopping: To prevent overfitting by monitoring validation performance.
